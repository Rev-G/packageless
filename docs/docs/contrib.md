Thanks for your interest in contributing to **packageless**!

## Initial steps
Before you contribute, you need to do a couple things:
- Fork the **packageless** repository
- Clone your forked repository

Next you need to decide if you want to create a new feature or help resolve an issue. If you want to help resolve an issue, make sure to comment on the issue that you would like to work on it so that it doesn't get assigned to someone else. 

If you want to work on a new feature, get to coding!

## Open a Pull Request
Once your code changes are finished and pushed up to your forked repository, open a new Pull Request with your changes, ensuring that you fill out the proper fields from the Pull Request template.

The one field that all Pull Requests must have checked is whether or not all tests have passed locally after running `go test ./...`
